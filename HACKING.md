PushPin is a dynamic playground for creating and sharing your ideas. PushPin works online, offline, and with or without access to the broader internet. PushPin is designed to be extended, and we want you to give that a try.

You can make PushPin into almost anything by replacing the right pieces. You could keep it as a "pushpin" style board by adding new kinds of content, or you could replace the Board.tsx at the root of the workspace and build almost anything else from a drum machine to a wiki.

# Installing PushPin

Before you begin, you're going to need to install PushPin on your computer.

Go to [github.com/automerge/pushpin](https://github.com/automerge/pushpin) and check out the repository there.

From the checked-out copy, run the following commands:

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

By default, your PushPin data will be written to a platform-specific location. You can find the data directory by opening the app and running `> require('./constants).USER_DATA` If you get in trouble and the app won't run anymore, you can change your username with `export NAME=userB` (or any other name.) If you've somehow corrupted your application data so badly the app won't start please don't delete it! We'd like to see what happened and make the app resilient to that failure mode.

# Extending PushPin

There are a two simple concepts to understand that make PushPin work:

Everything you see in PushPin is Content; where Content is a Hypermerge Document (the data) combined with a React Component (the code). Content classes can be loaded from anywhere but are by convention added to `./src/renderer/Root.tsx` and register themselves with the `ContentTypes`API at the end of their file.

Let's start with a basic example of a PushPin component.

### Thread

Open `./src/renderer/components/content-types/Thread.tsx` in your preferred editor.

You can see that the Thread code looks mostly like a simple React component. That's because it is! The Toggle component gets it state from a Hypermerge document. The document is available inside the component via the `useDocument()` hook.

## Pushpin URIs

Pushpin uses the `hypermerge:` protocol for URIs that can be shared.

![Pushpin URI](./docs/pushpin-uri.svg)

The first part of the URL tells our storage engine, Hypermerge, what document we're trying to render. The "pushpinContentType" tells the PushPin front-end which renderer to use to show it.

## Hypermerge Document

A Hypermerge document is a live, versioned data structure. You can read its contents, change it, and subscribe to it to hear its changes. Every change made to a Hypermerge document is captured and distributed to other instances of the document whether they are within your local document or another user's copy anywhere else in the world.

A document is an instance of an Automerge document. It's a data structure that includes its own full history, along with all the identities of the authors that edited it. You can treat it like a basic Javascript object, and store and nest numbers, strings, arrays, or maps. To read it, just index into it like any other Javascript object.

To update your document, create a handle from the hypermergeUrl, and then modify it via the `change()`function. Inside the callback, mutate the data structure how you like, and Automerge will record the changes you make and append them to your personal work log for distribution to other clients.

Those changes are also written into a Hypercore. Hypercore is an append-only log which is subsequently distributed using Hyperdiscovery to any other client who has the key to request it. Each entry in a hypercore is signed with the previous element's hash and a private key only the author has access to. This ensures that hypercores can be validated and distributed by anyone regardless of their contents.

When a new user wants to submit changes to your hypermerge document, they offer a hypercore to your client that will include their work. Your client accepts those changes and, as they arrive, surfaces all changes made either locally or remotely to your React component within the onChange handler.

## React Component

React components are essentially bundles of state and rendering logic. They define new pseudo-tags in your application. In our environment, we take components like `TextContent`, `ImageContent`, and `Thread`and nest them inside other components like the `Board` or the `Workspace` which provide navigation or other infrastructure.

To make them work with Hypermerge, the generic `<Content/>` component will look up a React component to instantiate based on the type field of the pushpin URL. Then it will pass in the docID as a property to the component.

From there, the component creates a handle to the Hypermerge document and listens to it for changes.

We provide a few different hooks like `useDocument()` to help you get going, including `useMessaging()` and `usePresence()` which you can use to broadcast information to other online users.

## The PushPin Data Model

Out of the box, PushPin consists of a number of nested documents. The outermost document is your workspace, which contains references to everything below it. The image below shows approximately how this works but probably has some out of date class or field names, so don't treat it as canonical.

![alt_text](docs/data-architecture.png 'data architecture')

## Everything is Content

All of the elements described above are instantiated as "Content" blocks in the application. That means that there is a place in the application with a tag that looks like this:

```
<Content url="hypermerge:/23409ad08d7c6a7d7fe793561?pushpinContentType=board/>
<Content url="hypermerge:/23409ad08d7c6a7d7fe793561?pushpinContentType=title-bar/>
```

In theory, anywhere you see a content node, any kind of content can be loaded. In practice, we are still developing the programming models and APIs to make this ergonomic. For example, you can place a `<Content type="board"/>` inside another board, but the code for drag-and-drop and the context menu to create new cards might not do what you want.

**Context**

You can ignore the context property of a content object when you're getting started, and it is optional for components. By default, without specifying a context like `<Content context="title-bar"/>` the system will load the default component for a particular document type. When registering a component, if you don't specify a "context" property, that component will be used any time a more specific context is not available.

That said, it can be handy to render different versions of a document type under different circumstances. For example, when placed on another board, the "board" component appears as a link. When rendered as a search result in the omnibox, it appears as a list entry, and when rendered at the root of the workspace, it is an actual board for arranging cards upon. Similarly, user avatars appear somewhat differently throughout the application.

To see examples of this in action, see the `./src/renderer/components/content-types/contact` directory.

_If you have suggestions about how to improve this model, please let us know!_

## Making your own Content type

1.  Duplicate and rename `./src/renderer/components/ThreadContent.tsx`. \
    For example: `./src/renderer/components/HelloWorldContent.tsx`
1.  Rename the component: \
    `export default function HelloWorld` [â€¦]
1.  Edit `Root.tsx` to load your component: \
    `import './content-types/HelloWorldContent'`
1.  Write some code that renders something interesting! Implement some actions that modify data to share with the world. If you want to use ephemeral data, look for the heartbeat code around avatars as an example, or how selections work on Board.tsx.
1.  Add CSS styles to a companion `HelloWorldContent.css`, or better yet, use or improve some of our existing components like Badge, Heading, and CenteredStack.
1.  Modify the component registry at the bottom of your component file to describe your component. Consider what (if anything) the min, max, and default Width and Height should be and set those, too.

### The Component Registry

The component registry is a simple dictionary of components. Every component gets a class, a name, an icon (we use [line-awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome/cheatsheet) for icons), and a text string of its name for showing users. In addition there are some special properties you can add optionally:

The type definition for a content type is:

```
interface ContentType {
  type: string
  name: string
  icon: string
  unlisted?: boolean // should this be listed in the right-click menu on board?
  resizable?: boolean // do we allow this content to be resized?
  contexts: Contexts // a map from context names like "workspace", "board", and "list" to implementations
  create?: (typeAttrs: any, handle: Handle<any>) => Promise<void> | void // a function to create new document instances
  createFrom?: (contentData: ContentData, handle: Handle<any>) => Promise<void> | void // a function to create instances from files
  supportsMimeType?: (type: string) => boolean // should this type claim to take care of a particular file's mime-type?
}

```

## Good luck!

PushPin is a number of things: a useful tool, an experiment in programming models, and a proof of concept of a technical stack. Hopefully it's also a bunch of fun to play with and experiment on and we look forward to seeing what you build with it. Pull requests are very welcome (we could always use more useful components) and bug reports will be at least considered.

_Please reach out to @pvh if you have questions, ideas, or suggestions. Let me know if you get stuck, or if you're wondering how to begin. I'd love to hear about what you're doing._
